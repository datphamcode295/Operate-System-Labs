PID of child process = 3235 
PARENT: value = 19
1. What the output will be at LINE A? Does this value not change for every process
executions? Explain your answer.
	- The output of line A is 3235. Every time the process executed, the value of line A 
	by adding 2. Ex: the next value is 3237, then 3239,...
	- Explain: When the program executed, it take new id process and then fork() was
	called to creat child take an id+1. The next execution will creat a new parent process
	take id+2 and similar the child take id+3. That why every time the process executed, 
	the value of line A change by adding 2 (there are 2 processes created every time the 
	program executed).

2. What the output will be at LINE C? Explain your answer.
	- The output of Line C is 19. Because the command is in the parent process, which do not effect by changing in child process variable. Therefore, it is unchanged.

3. Remove line C from the program. Observe your display result onto the screen and
give your remark.
	- The parent will be executed first and its output would be on the screen before the 
	child. This is because wait() function was deleted so the parent process do not need to waiting for child process anymore. Therefore,
	the printf in parent can display before the child.
