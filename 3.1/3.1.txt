1.
Makefile save time when you have too much file in your project. For example, in exercise 3.3 intead of use 4 long command for factorial, 
readline and main you just need type "make all".

2.
The following makefile defines paths to the include and lib directories, and places the object files in an obj subdirectory within the src directory.
 It also has a macro defined for any libraries you want to include, such as the math library -lm. This makefile should be located in the src directory. 
Note that it also includes a rule for cleaning up your source and object directories if you type make clean. 
The .PHONY rule keeps make from doing something with a file named clean.
